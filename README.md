# üöÇ üèî IRL Ticket to Ride: `webpaige` migrations
### _Winter 2021 - 2022_

### Hello, stranger!

This winter, I'll be traveling around the United States, taking advantage of Amtrak's very reasonably priced $499 Rail Pass. With this pass, each intrepid explorer has the ability to book 10 one-way rail trips around the United States during a 30 day period. Adventures abound!

### The Plan:

From December 12th through February 4th, I'll be sprinting through the following cities:

## ‚úÖ `The Plan` (at least, as of today)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynamicwebpaige/IRL-ticket-to-ride/main/plots/Screen%20Shot%202021-12-18%20at%207.10.27%20PM.png)

There will almost certainly be snags, delays, and poor weather along the way - and I'll be documenting **everything**. Each one of these cities has amazing culture, friends to visit, and family to hug - not to mention great food and coffee. I can't wait to share my experiences with you, and to take in, first-hand, everything that the United States has to offer.

Stay tuned, and please send me recommendations for stops! They're always appreciated. ü§ó
